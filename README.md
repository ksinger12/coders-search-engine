# coder's-search-engine

The goal of this project is to create a coder's search engine. While coding, I run into many issues (especially at work) that often involve scowering different resources like github, stackoverflow, google etc. The idea here is to create a one-off search engine that is able to check all of the resources at once and return the results to help speed up the searching process. Steps to run the code is coming soon.
